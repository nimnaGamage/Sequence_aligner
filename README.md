# Sequence aligner

This Python program uses Biopython and other 3rd party packages to align biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and amino acid)

This program includes methods to 
  - calculate the global pairwise similarity score, melting temperature, isoelectric point and aromaticity of given sequences 
  - generate a dot plot to represent pairwise similarity  
  - run BLAST searches on several sequence inputs
